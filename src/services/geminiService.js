    title: 'Dashboard',
    description: 'Real-time monitoring hub showing overview of all ETL operations',
    details: `The Dashboard displays four key metric cards at the top:
- Total Pipelines: Shows count of all pipelines in the system
- Active Pipelines: Number of pipelines currently enabled and ready to run
- Data Sources: Total configured database, file, and API connections
- Recent Executions: Count of pipeline runs in the last 24 hours

Below the metrics, there are two main sections:
1. Pipeline Status Chart: Pie chart showing distribution of pipeline statuses (Active, Inactive, Failed)
2. Recent Executions Table: Lists the 5 most recent pipeline runs with columns for Pipeline Name, Status (Running/Completed/Failed), Start Time, Duration, and Records Processed

Quick action buttons allow creating new pipelines and data sources directly from the dashboard.`,
    features: [
      'Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds (configurable in Settings)',
      'Click on any execution to view detailed logs',
      'Status badges use color coding: green (completed), blue (running), red (failed)',

  },
  pipelines: {
    title: 'Pipelines',
    description: 'Create and manage ETL pipelines that orchestrate data movement',
    details: `Pipelines are the core of the ETL platform. Each pipeline defines:
- Source: Where data comes from (database, file, or API)
- Destination: Where data goes to
- Transformations: Optional data modifications applied during transfer
- Field Mappings: How source fields map to destination fields
- Schedule: When the pipeline runs (manual, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)

The pipeline list shows:
- Name and description
- Source → Destination flow
- Status (Active/Inactive)
- Last execution time and status
- Actions: Edit, Clone, Delete, Execute Now

Creating a Pipeline:
1. Click "Create Pipeline" button
2. Enter name and description
3. Select source data source (must have "source" or "both" direction)
4. Select destination data source (must have "destination" or "both" direction)
5. Optionally add transformations (applied in order)
6. Map source fields to destination fields using the visual mapper
7. Set schedule (None for manual execution only)
8. Save and optionally execute immediately

Field Mapping:
- Drag source fields to destination fields
- Supports one-to-one mappings
- Unmapped fields are ignored
- Validation ensures all required destination fields are mapped`,
    features: [
      'Clone existing pipelines to create similar ones quickly',
      'Execute pipelines manually with "Run Now" button',

    details: `Data Sources represent connections to external systems. Three types are supported:

1. DATABASE Sources:
   - Supported: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL
   - Configuration: Server, Port, Database Name, Username, Password
   - Schema: Auto-detected by querying database metadata
   - Direction: Source (read), Destination (write), or Both
   - Write Config (for destinations): Table name, Operation (INSERT/UPDATE/UPSERT/BULK_INSERT), Primary keys, Batch size

2. FILE Sources:
   - Supported formats: CSV, Excel (.xlsx), JSON
   - Configuration: File path on server
   - CSV: Delimiter, has headers, encoding
   - Excel: Sheet name, start row
   - JSON: Root path for nested data
   - Schema: Auto-detected from file structure or manually defined
   - Write Config (for destinations): Write mode (overwrite/append), column order, sheet name

3. API Sources:
   - Configuration: Base URL, endpoint, HTTP method (GET/POST/PUT)
   - Authentication: None, Basic Auth, API Key, Bearer Token
   - Headers: Custom HTTP headers
   - Query parameters for GET requests
   - Request body template for POST/PUT
   - Schema: Manually defined based on API response structure
   - Write Config (for destinations): Request format (JSON/XML/Form Data), batch size, root key

Schema Definition:
- Each field has: Name, Data Type (String/Integer/Decimal/Boolean/Date), Required flag
- Auto-detection available for databases and files
- Manual definition required for APIs
- Schema validation ensures data compatibility`,
    features: [
      'Test Connection button validates credentials before saving',
      'Clone data sources to create similar configurations',
      'Direction setting determines if source can be used in pipelines',

  transformations: {
    title: 'Transformations',
    description: 'Define reusable data transformation rules',
    details: `Transformations modify data as it flows through pipelines. Seven types available:

1. FILTER Transformation:
   - Purpose: Remove rows that don't meet conditions
   - Configuration: Field name, Operator (equals, not equals, contains, starts with, ends with, greater than, less than, is empty, is not empty), Value
   - Example: Filter rows where Status equals "Active"
   - Multiple conditions can be combined

2. MAP Transformation:
   - Purpose: Replace field values using lookup table
   - Configuration: Field name, Key-value mappings
   - Example: Map "US" → "United States", "UK" → "United Kingdom"
   - Unmapped values pass through unchanged

3. TRIM Transformation:
   - Purpose: Remove leading/trailing whitespace
   - Configuration: Field names to trim
   - Useful for cleaning imported data

4. CASE_CONVERT Transformation:
   - Purpose: Change text case
   - Options: UPPERCASE, lowercase, Title Case, camelCase
   - Configuration: Field names and target case
   - Example: Convert all email addresses to lowercase

5. SUBSTRING Transformation:
   - Purpose: Extract portion of text
   - Configuration: Field name, Start position, Length
   - Example: Extract first 3 characters of product code

6. REPLACE Transformation:
   - Purpose: Find and replace text
   - Configuration: Field name, Find text, Replace text, Use regex (optional)
   - Example: Replace all dashes with underscores
   - Regex support for complex patterns

7. SCRIPT Transformation:
   - Purpose: Custom logic using JavaScript or C#
   - Configuration: Script language, Code editor with syntax highlighting
   - Access to row data via 'row' object
   - Return modified row object
   - Example: Calculate derived fields, complex validations
   - Most flexible but requires programming knowledge

Using Transformations in Pipelines:
- Add multiple transformations to a pipeline
- Transformations execute in order (top to bottom)
- Each transformation receives output from previous one
- Can reuse same transformation in multiple pipelines`,
    features: [
      'Clone transformations to create variations',
      'Test transformations with sample data before using in pipelines',

${pageContext.description}

${pageContext.details}

Key Features on this page:
${pageContext.features.map(f => `- ${f}`).join('\n')}

=== GENERAL APP INFORMATION ===
Application: Multi-Tenant ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Platform
Purpose: Move and transform data between different systems with complete tenant isolation

Core Concepts:
- Data Sources: Connections to databases (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL), files (CSV, Excel, JSON), or REST APIs
- Pipelines: Orchestrate data movement from source → transformations → destination
- Transformations: Modify data during transfer (filter, map, trim, case convert, substring, replace, custom scripts)
- Executions: Historical record of pipeline runs with detailed logs
- Tenants: Organizations with isolated data (multi-customer support)
- Users: Two roles - Admin (full access) and User (limited access)

Navigation:
- Dashboard: Overview and metrics
- Pipelines: Create and manage data flows
- Data Sources: Configure connections
- Transformations: Define data modification rules
- Executions: Monitor pipeline runs
- Users: Manage accounts (Admin only)
- Tenants: Manage organizations (Admin only)
- Settings: Personal preferences and API keys

=== RESPONSE GUIDELINES ===
- Provide specific, actionable answers based on the current page context
- Use 2-4 sentences for simple questions, more detail for complex topics
- Reference exact button names, field names, and UI elements when explaining how to do something
- If the user asks about features on a different page, briefly explain and tell them which page to navigate to
- For technical questions, provide step-by-step instructions
- Be conversational but professional
- If you don't know something specific about the implementation, say so honestly`;
