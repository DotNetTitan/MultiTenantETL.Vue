- **User**: Access to pipelines, connectors, transformations, and executions within their tenant

## Key Workflows

1. **Connector Setup**: Configure connections to databases, file systems, or APIs with schema auto-detection or manual definition
2. **Transformation Creation**: Define data transformations using built-in templates (Filter, Map, Trim, Case Convert, Substring, Replace) or custom JavaScript/C# scripts with syntax highlighting
3. **Pipeline Configuration**: Connect source → transformations → destination with visual field mapping, validation, and pipeline wizard
4. **Execution & Monitoring**: Run pipelines manually or on schedule, monitor progress with real-time logs, timeline view, and execution history

## Supported Connector Types

- **Databases**: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL (with connection testing and schema auto-detection)
- **Files**: CSV (PapaParse), Excel/XLSX (XLSX library), JSON (with file preview and validation)
- **APIs**: REST APIs with configurable endpoints, authentication, and headers

## Transformation Types

1. **Filter**: Filter rows based on field values with operators (equals, contains, greater than, less than, starts with, ends with, etc.)
2. **Map**: Transform field values using key-value mappings with default values
3. **Trim**: Remove leading/trailing whitespace from text fields
4. **Case Convert**: Convert text to uppercase, lowercase, title case, or camelCase
5. **Substring**: Extract portions of text from fields with start/end positions
6. **Replace**: Find and replace text or patterns (with regex support)
7. **Script**: Custom JavaScript or C# transformation logic with Prism.js syntax highlighting

## Internationalization

- **Supported Languages**: English (en), Spanish (es), French (fr), German (de), Italian (it), Portuguese (pt)
- **Translation Coverage**: All UI components, validation messages, error messages, metadata labels
- **AI Chatbot**: Responds in user's selected language
- **Language Persistence**: User preference saved in localStorage
- **Easy Extension**: Add new languages by creating JSON files in `src/locales/`
